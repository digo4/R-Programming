#Getting Started
#Here are some examples:
10+20 #addition

#Assigning variable using `=` or `<-` - assignment operators. 
a = 20-34 #subtraction
a
b = 3*2 #multiplication
b
c = 45/5  #division
c
42^10 #power 

#The concatenate function `c()`is used a lot in R, also for expressing vectors.
print(c(a,b,c))
# Without c() it just prints the first variable
print(a,b,c)

#To locate the list of all the variables used so far, use the `ls()` command.
ls()

#To remove a variable from the list , use `rm()` function.
rm(a) #removes the variable a. We can reconfirm that a has been removed by rechecking ls().
