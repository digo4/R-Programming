# R-Programming
Hi Coders! \
I have hereby compiled a set of instructions for understanding the basics of R Programming language.

Before we begin, let's revisit some concepts.

So what is R ?

R is a dialect of the S programming language, written and developed by John Chambers in Bell Labs. R is a relatively recent development ( in 1991) , created in New Zealand by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman.

## Installation:
There are three steps you need to follow in a sequential order:
1. **Install Perl** : Before installing R, make sure to install Perl first, becuase many of the libraries in R are written in Perl. If you are using Linux or macOS, your system already comes with Perl installed. For Windows, you need to install Perl separately. Follow this link for perl installation : https://www.perl.org/get.html
2. **Install R** :
   - For Windows : https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
   - For macOS : https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
   - For Linux : Follow the appropriate command depending on your Linux version 
     
     `$ sudo apt install r-base`  - For Debian or Ubuntu
     
     `$ sudo dnf install R `   - For RedHat or Fedora
                                                                                                 
     `$ sudo pacman -S r `    - For Arch or Manjaro
                                                                                             
     `$ sudo zypper install R-base R-base-devel`    - For OpenSUSE

   After finishing the installation, 
4. **Install RStudio**
