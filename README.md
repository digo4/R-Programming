# R-Programming
Hi Coders! \
I have hereby compiled a set of instructions for understanding the basics of R Programming language.

## Installation:
There are three steps you need to follow in a sequential order:
1. **Install Perl** (Before installing R, make sure to install Perl first, becuase many of the libraries in R are written in Perl. If you are using Linux or macOS, your system already comes with Perl installed. For Windows, you need to install Perl separately).
2. **Install R**
3. **Install RStudio**
